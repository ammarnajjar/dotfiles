# Dotfiles Configurations

My own vim configurations for fedora/debian, Tmux and urxvt.  
It will be installed in the current directory with symlinks to the correct paths.  
Because the plugins are always changing and depend on the current projects I am working on, I put them in `plugins` branch`.`  

## Install using: 

Make a backup for your settings then:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarnajjar/dotfiles/master/install.sh && sh install.sh
```
